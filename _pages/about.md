## Me

I work as a senior software developer / architect in the Copenhagen area in Denmark. 
I have worked with software development for 20 years, most of the time as a developer, but have also worked a couple of years as a project manager and had many of the other roles involved when working on software projects. 

## My professional interests

I tend to be more interested in things that are useful as part of my general toolbox, i.e. across programming languages and technologies:

* design both at the code and architecture level.
* continuous integration, delivery and deployment.
* event driven architecture
* automated testing
* reactive systems
* development "infrastructure": tools for version control, build, test and deployment

## What is my blog for?

It is my intention to use this blog for:

* writing about technical stuff I use either at work or in hobby projects.
* It will also be my way of tracking what I
  * get done from week to week, so I hope to have at least one monthly post.
  * have been working with and the problems I encountered.
* reviewing books or blogs I read.
