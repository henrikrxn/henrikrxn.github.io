## Me

I work as a freelance senior software developer / architect in the Copenhagen
area in Denmark.

I have worked with software development for 20 years, most of the time as a
developer, but have also worked a couple of years as a project manager and
had many of the other roles involved when working on software projects.

## My professional interests

I tend to be more interested in things that are useful as part of my general
toolbox, i.e. across programming languages and technologies:

* continuous integration, delivery and deployment
* development "infrastructure": tools for version control, build, test and deployment
* design both at the code and architecture level
* event driven architecture and messaging
* automated testing
* reactive systems

## What is my blog for?

It is my intention to use this blog for:

* writing about technical stuff I use either at work or in hobby projects.
* reviewing books or blogs I read.
