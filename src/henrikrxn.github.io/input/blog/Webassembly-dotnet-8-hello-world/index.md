Title: "WebAssembly 'Hello World' on .NET 8 Preview 4"

A word of warning: I am a noob at WebAssembly, WASI and WASM, so some of the
stuff in this post is probably superfluous, maybe even wrong. I could not yet
find much information online, so I have just been trying stuff.

I mostly wrote the post for my own sake as a log of what I did when I get
the time to pick this up again.

You can find the source code for this post [here](https://github.com/henrikrxn/webassembly-experiments/tree/main/wasiconsole-hello-world).
The initial commit is the code as generated by `dotnet new` and I since made
modifications to the README.md to correct the things I could not get to work.

## Scenario for this post: Hello World

The scenario I want to try is:

1. Build a WASI compatible .wasm file using .NET 8 Preview 4.
2. Use [Wasmtime CLI](https://github.com/BytecodeAlliance/wasmtime) to run that file.
Amongst other things the Wasmtime CLI is a standalone WebAssembly runtime.

The .NET code only needs to do something identifiable, e.g. write to the console.

## What I found about WASI support in .NET

An [issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/65895) in the Github repository
`dotnet/runtime` tracking WASI support in the .NET runtime.

There is another Github repository [dotnet/dotnet-wasi-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-wasi-sdk/),
but it looks like this has been abandoned because of the ongoing work in `dotnet/runtime`.

Steve Sanderson also has an even older Github repository
[SteveSandersonMS/dotnet-wasi-sdk](https://github.com/SteveSandersonMS/dotnet-wasi-sdk/)
that also looks abandoned.

## What I ended up having installed

My strategy for the 'Hello World' has been to install everything sounding
remotely relevant, because there is little information available and I did not
want to have to fight strange error messages.

* [.NET 8 Preview 4](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
* Visual Studio Community 2022 Preview 17.7.0 Preview 1
* A number of .NET workloads for WebAssembly
* [Wasmtime CLI](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/)

See specifics on what I installed and how I did it at the end of the article.

## Making the 'Hello World' program

I used a Powershell 7 prompt:

* `PS> mkdir wasiconsole-hello-world`
* `PS> cd wasiconsole-hello-world`
* `PS> dotnet new wasiconsole`
* `PS> dotnet build -c Debug`
* `PS> dotnet run -c Debug`

Or if you want to use the Wasmtime CLI directly:

* `PS> cd .\bin\Debug\net8.0\wasi-wasm\AppBundle\`
* `PS> wasmtime .\dotnet.wasm --dir . wasiconsole-hello-world`

The option `--dir .` enables the Wasmtime CLI to read the files it needs.
My guess the need for this might go away in a later preview, but time will tell.

This is a little different from what's written in the generated README.md, but even
after correcting the obvious mistake in the path I could not get the instructions
in the generated README.md to work, so I did this instead.

## Summary and observations

* Using the wasiconsole template I got a simple program.
* dotnet could build it into something that could run on the Wasmtime CLI.

There are a couple of observations:

1. It is not one self-contained .wasm file.
   Rather a `dotnet.wasm` file and a bunch of dlls in a folder.
   My guess is that dotnet.wasm is the same as used in Blazor Webassembly.
2. It was surprisingly easy to get up and running.

## Going forward

I'll either update this post as I find out more or make follow-up posts.

I'll also try to keep this post updated as more .NET 8 previews are released.

My longer term goal is to play with WebAssembly interoperability between
different languages outside of the browser.

## Details: Installed software

Again, mostly so I know what I did. Nothing fancy here.

### .NET SDK

I already had [.NET 8 Preview 4](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
installed.

### Visual Studio

I already had Visual Studio Community 2022 Preview 17.7.0 Preview 1 with these
relevant "individual components" installed:

* .NET 6.0 WebAssembly Build Tools
* .NET 7.0 WebAssembly Build Tools
* .NET WebAssembly Build Tools

I ended up using the dotnet CLI, but I have no idea if the Visual
Studio components contributed in any way.

### .NET workloads

I ended up having these .NET workloads installed:

* wasi-experimental
* wasm-experimental
* wasm-tools-net7
* wasm-tools-net6 (came from Visual Studio)
* wasm-tools (came from Visual Studio)

I had previously not used workloads and could not find much online except the
dotnet CLI reference, so these commands helped me:

NB: The `dotnet workload` commands are influenced by `global.json` files.

Remember to check that you are targeting .NET 8 with `dotnet --info`.

* `dotnet workload list`
  Lists the workloads you have installed for the SDK currently in scope.
* `dotnet workload search`
  Finds all available workloads, but there are not that many yet, so that is OK.
* `dotnet workload install <workload id>`

### Wasmtime CLI

Installed Wasmtime CLI [9.0.2](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/tag/v9.0.2)

I used the MSI because 9.0.2 is not yet available thru `winget`.

#### Minor nuisance with Wasmtime CLI on Windows

When upgrading there are a couple of things to note:

* Upgrading does not correctly uninstall older versions which still show up in
"Control Panel -> Programs and Features" and if you are using Winget it will
keep insisting that there is an upgrade available.
* If you after upgrading to latest uninstall any older versions thru "Control Panel"
then you need to either:
  * Add the wasmtime CLI to your path again
  * Winget: Remove and re-install to get the path set-up properly
  * In "Control Panel" choose "Repair" to fix the path

So if you do not want older versions lying around then the best way to ensure
that everything works:

1. Uninstall the wasmtime CLI you currently have
2. Install the new version you want
