## Professional bio

I work as a freelance (senior or lead) software developer / software architect
in the Copenhagen area in Denmark.

I have worked with software development since 1997, most of the time as a
developer, but have also worked a couple of years as a project manager and
had many of the other roles involved when working on software projects.

Most of my work has been on backs-end, but I have done a number of project
involving front-end, both web and desktop.

## Professional areas of interest

I tend to be more interested in things that are useful as part of my general
toolbox, i.e. across programming languages and technologies:

- continuous integration, delivery and deployment
- development "infrastructure": tools for version control, build, test and deployment
- automated testing
- design both at the code and architecture level
- event driven architecture and messaging
- reactive systems

## What is this blog for

It is my intention to use this blog for:

- writing about technical stuff I use either at work or in hobby projects.
- reviewing books or blogs I read.
