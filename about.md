# About my blog

It is my intention to use this blog for:

* writing about technical stuff I use either at work or in hobby projects.
* It will also be my way of tracking what I
  * get done from week to week, so I hope to have at least one monthly post.
  * have been working with and the problems I encountered.
* reviewing books or blogs I read.

## My professional interests

I tend to be more interested in things that are useful as part of my general toolbox, i.e. across programming languages and technologies:

* design both at the code and architecture level.
* continuous integration, delivery and deployment.
* event driven architecture
* automated testing
* reactive systems
* development "infrastructure": tools for version control, build, test and deployment
