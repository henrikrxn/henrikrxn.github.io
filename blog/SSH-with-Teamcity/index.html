<p>For a product I worked on we needed to extract data from a Software as a Service
(SaaS) SAP installation as part of our TeamCity build jobs in Azure, but we only
had access to the SAP system from within our own network because of the SaaS
provider's white list policy. Adding our Azure build agents to the white list
was not an option as build agents were created as needed and disposed after a
given period of inactivity.</p>
<p>That TeamCity agents were created as needed also limits the ability to configure
SSH for the user running the actual TeamCity build process as this configuration
would be wiped for each new agent because of <code>sysprep</code>.</p>
<p>However we had the possibility of opening a SSH tunnel with local port forwarding
to a machine within our network and thus access the SAP installation.</p>
<p>So for better or for worse that is what we decided to do. This post describes
the solution and the process of arriving at that solution plus identifying a
few shortcomings.</p>
<p>What we did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a passphraseless SSH key for accessing the SSH tunnel.
<code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048</code></li>
<li>Store the passphraseless SSH key in TeamCity using the
<a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/SSH+Keys+Management">built-in functionality for uploading an SSH key</a>.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD10/SSH+Agent">TeamCity's built-in SSH Agent</a>
functionality for opening a tunnel to the machine on our local network.</li>
</ul>
<p>However the main problem with this approach was that the TeamCity SSH Agent keeps
the tunnel open as long as the TeamCity agent is active. So a way to close the
tunnel again was needed.</p>
<p>So we used the SSH config file to get access to the <code>ControlMaster</code> feature.</p>
<pre><code class="language-language-shell-session">Host &lt;DNS entry&gt;
BatchMode yes
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath ~/.ssh/ssh-%u-%i-%r&#64;%h-%p
ExitOnForwardFailure yes
LocalForward &lt;local port&gt; &lt;remote IP&gt;:&lt;remote port&gt;
StrictHostKeyChecking no
User &lt;Username for SSH tunnel&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>By using the control master it is possible to open the connection at the
beginning of the build job:</p>
<pre><code class="language-language-bash">ssh -F &quot;./ssh/config&quot; -fn -M -N -T &lt;DNS entry&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>and at the end of a build job simply shutdown the connection:</p>
<pre><code class="language-language-bash">ssh -F &quot;./ssh/config&quot; -T -O &quot;exit&quot; -o &quot;LogLevel=ERROR&quot; &lt;DNS entry&gt;
</code></pre>

different switches used.</p>
