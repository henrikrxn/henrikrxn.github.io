<h2 id="professional-bio">Professional bio</h2>
<p>I work as a freelance (senior or lead) software developer / software architect
in the Copenhagen area in Denmark.</p>
<p>I have worked with software development since 1997, most of the time as a
developer, but have also worked a couple of years as a project manager and
had many of the other roles involved when working on software projects.</p>
<p>Most of my work has been on backs-end, but I have done a number of project
involving front-end, both web and desktop.</p>
<h2 id="professional-areas-of-interest">Professional areas of interest</h2>
<p>I tend to be more interested in things that are useful as part of my general
toolbox, i.e. across programming languages and technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>continuous integration, delivery and deployment</li>
<li>development &quot;infrastructure&quot;: tools for version control, build, test and deployment</li>
<li>automated testing</li>
<li>design both at the code and architecture level</li>
<li>event driven architecture and messaging</li>
<li>reactive systems</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-this-blog-for">What is this blog for</h2>
<p>It is my intention to use this blog for:</p>
<ul>
<li>writing about technical stuff I use either at work or in hobby projects.</li>
<li>reviewing books or blogs I read.</li>
</ul>
