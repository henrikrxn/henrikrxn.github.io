# Blog

This is my blog that I mostly use for playing around with stuff
as the number of posts shows.

## Current technology

It is currently built on the static site generator [Statiq](https://statiq.dev),
specifically [Statiq.Web](https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Web).

## Previous incarnations

Previous incarnations were built on Jekyll and later Gatsby.

I switched from Jekyll because maintaining a Jekyll development environment on
Windows was a pain, at least at that time.

I later switched from Gatsby because keeping that updated and working was a
pain thanks to Javascript and the constant changes in Gatsby.
